   - Highlight red flags that require further attention or clarification.

3. **Preventative Measures**:
   - Suggest follow-up steps, general preventative measures, or tests discussed in the transcription.
   - Ensure these are clear and aligned with the content provided.

4. **Formatting**:
   - Structure the report in **markdown** using appropriate headings, subheadings, and bullet points for clarity.
   - Prioritize readability while ensuring all critical information is included.
   - Example formatting:
     ```markdown
     # Health Report
     - **Overall Impression**: ...
     - **Identified Risks**: ...
     - **Lifestyle Factors**: ...
     - **Follow-Up/Preventative Measures**: ...
     ```
   - Use additional sections as necessary, depending on the content discussed in the transcription.

   - Do not make assumptions about missing data or provide speculative analysis.

6. **Objectivity**:
